Notes\r\n* Problem get amplified for Oracle DB.  The reason for this is that by default, the Oracle JDBC driver fetch results of a SQL query streaming it from DB by 10 rows at a time. In a situation where a table has 150k records, 15k round trips will be required for the complete information of the table to reach the application. When the sprint cache gets flushed, a full table scan of the {{AO_60DB71_SPRINT}} table is performed to populate the sprint cache.\r\n* Using an instance where 150k sprints exist as an example in Oracle DB , 15k rounds trips between the application and the database will be required for the entire data set to be retrieved by the thread waiting on this information - this translates to a total of 15 seconds if the latency between Jira and the DB server is at 1ms. An increased latency between the app server and the DB server will increase the time it takes for the full results of the query to reach the application exponentially.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\n* For Oracle DB, Increase the number of results that can be fetched at a single time by the Oracle JDBC driver:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18283_01/java.112/e16548/resltset.htm#i1023619\r\nThis can be done by adding the following line to the {{dbconfig.xml}} file, inside the {{<jdbc-datasource>}} section:\r\n{code}\r\n<connection-properties>defaultRowPrefetch=XXX</connection-properties>\r\n{code}\r\n(i) XXX translates to the numerical value of results we'll be fetching. The default value is 10 - we have seen an increase to _200_ being very effective while adding very little overhead to the JVM's memory utilization.\r\n* See also a related KB [Using the default Oracle JDBC fetch size may lead to performance issues in Jira|https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/using-the-default-oracle-jdbc-fetch-size-may-lead-to-performance-issues-in-jira-1014278793.html]","creationDate":"2020-07-02","comments":[],"uri":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/latest/issue/1583456","reporterName":"Lucas Bugs"},{"key":"JSWSERVER-20617","priority":"Low","type":"Bug","summary":"Epic Burndown report does not display the chart depending on how the Epic Link was created.","description":"h3.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAt times bulk deletion of projects are carried out to clean up the instance and reduce the load on the index. During deletion of the projects, the instance becomes unusable and causes significant performance degrade. Customer analysis shows that this originates from the large number of queries being run in the database individually rather than in batches and very frequently. The time taken for individual query, even though smaller adds up significantly in total, when the database is located remotely.\r\n\r\n !Database_query.png|thumbnail! \r\n\r\nOur Analysis shows that this is because to in the delete command, the code around workflows & workflow schemes doesn’t batch the database calls so well. Moreover, we’re often accessing these workflows through caches—yet we clear the caches partway through the process (before dealing with draft workflows) owing to the fix for JRASERVER-8032\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Create 200 - 300 test projects with one or more test issues using data generator plugin.\r\n # Try deletion of the projects in bulk using a plugin such as REST API or BobSwift CLI, the instance experiences large number of calls to the database contending with other normal user operations.\r\n\r\nh3.
